<h2>Data Analysis Projects</h2>

1. Covid-19 Data Project
This project is a demonstration of SQL queries and Tableau visualisation. The data was obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to perform the SQL queries.
The data was then exported back to Excel form and imported into Tableau. The link for the Tableau dashboard is in the project README file.

2. Data Cleaning Project
This project demonstrates my data cleaning abilities. I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio again to perform the SQL queries.

3. Python Project (coming soon)
