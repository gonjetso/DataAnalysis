<h2>Data Analysis Projects</h2>

<h3>1. Covid-19 Data Project</h3>
This project is a demonstration of SQL queries and Tableau visualisation. The data was obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to perform the SQL queries. The SQL skills demonstrated are Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.

The data was then exported back to Excel form and imported into Tableau. The link for the Tableau dashboard is in the project README file.

<h3>2. Data Cleaning Project</h3>
This project demonstrates my data cleaning abilities. I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio again to perform the SQL queries. The SQL skills demonstrated are Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.

<h3>3. Python Data Correlation Project</h3>
This project looks at movie data from various film studios and works what factors have a high correlation with gross earnings. The project uses the Python libraries
 pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.
 
 <h3>4. Weather Data Project</h3>
 This is another Python project analysis weather data and responding to basic questions about the data. The project uses the pandas library.

<h3>5. Car Data EDA Project</h3>
